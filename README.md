### Project Description:

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (JSON is JavaScript Object Notation. It is a syntax for storing and exchanging data, and it is also a subset of JavaScript. It is a simple, common representation of data.)
2. (Ajax allows client web pages to quickly interact and exchange data with a web server without reloading the entire web page. It relies on programming languages such as JavaScript.)
3. (A synchronous request stops the processing of the JavaScript code until a response is returned from the server. It is easier to handle, but the script will not continue processing until the response is received.)
